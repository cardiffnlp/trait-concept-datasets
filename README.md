# trait-concept-datasets
Datasets of trait-concept pairs for specific trait types in English and Spanish derived from McRae and Norms datasets [1,2]

The 5 trait types that are covered in the datasets are: **colours**, **components**, **materials**, **size & shape**, and **tactile**. For more details on how the dataset was constructed from the original datasets and details on the translation to Spanish see the original paper:

There are datasets for each trait type for both the McRae and Norms datasets and both single-labelled and multi-labelled.
